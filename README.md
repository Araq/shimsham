ShimSham
========

ShimSham is a Nim module to encompass several different digest/hashing algorithms. So far included are [Sha2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), [Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_%28cryptography%29), and [Whirlpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_%28cryptography%29). Hopefully there will be some more soon.
